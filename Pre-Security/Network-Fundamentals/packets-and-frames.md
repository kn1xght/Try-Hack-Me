# PACKETS & FRAMES

### Introduction  

Packets and frames are small pieces of data that come together to form a larger message.  
While they may sound similar, they operate at different layers of the **OSI model**.  

- A **packet** is data from **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** and includes information like the **IP header** and **payload**.  
- A **frame** operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**, encapsulating the packet and adding details such as **MAC addresses**.  

Think of it like mailing a letter:  
The **envelope** is the frame — it carries the **letter** (the packet) to its destination. Once the recipient opens the envelope, the message inside can be read and forwarded.  
This process is known as **encapsulation**.

### Why Packets Matter  

Breaking data into smaller packets makes communication more efficient.  
By sending small chunks instead of one large message, networks avoid bottlenecks and reduce the chance of congestion.  

Every packet type follows certain **protocol standards** to ensure all devices can interpret data correctly.  
Without these standards, billions of devices would have no reliable way to communicate.  

Common packet header fields include:  
- **Time to Live (TTL):** Prevents packets from endlessly circulating if undeliverable.  
- **Checksum:** Ensures data integrity — detects corruption in transmission.  
- **Source Address:** IP address of the sender.  
- **Destination Address:** IP address of the receiver.

### TCP/IP Model  

The **TCP/IP protocol** is often viewed as a practical, simplified version of the OSI model.  
It consists of four layers:  

1. **Application**  
2. **Transport**  
3. **Internet**  
4. **Network Interface**

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)  

TCP is **connection-oriented**, meaning it must establish a link between client and server before data is sent.  
This ensures reliability and accurate delivery — any data sent will be received in order.  
The process that sets up this connection is the **Three-Way Handshake**.  

**TCP Headers:**  
- **Source Port:** Randomly chosen port used to send the packet.  
- **Destination Port:** Port number of the receiving service (e.g., 80 for web traffic).  
- **Source IP / Destination IP:** Addresses of the sender and receiver.  
- **Sequence Number / Acknowledgement Number:** Keeps packets ordered and confirms delivery.  
- **Checksum:** Validates data integrity.  
- **Data:** The actual content being transmitted.  
- **Flags:** Indicate how packets are handled (e.g., SYN, ACK, FIN).  

**Three-Way Handshake:**  
1. **SYN:** Client initiates the connection.  
2. **SYN/ACK:** Server acknowledges and responds.  
3. **ACK:** Client confirms, and data transfer begins.  

Once finished, the **FIN** packet is sent to close the connection gracefully, or **RST** if terminated abruptly.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)  

UDP is **stateless** — it sends data without establishing or maintaining a connection.  
This makes it faster but less reliable than TCP.  
It’s used for scenarios where speed matters more than guaranteed delivery, like **video streaming** or **voice chat**.  

**UDP Headers:**  
- **Time to Live (TTL)**  
- **Source & Destination Addresses**  
- **Source & Destination Ports**  
- **Data**

### Ports and Common Protocols  

Ports are numbered gateways that allow data to enter or leave a device — much like ships docking at the correct port in a harbor.  
There are **65,535 ports** in total.  

Ports **0–1024** are known as **well-known ports** used by standard protocols:  

| Protocol | Port | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **FTP** | 21 | File sharing between client and server. |
| **SSH** | 22 | Secure remote login via text interface. |
| **HTTP** | 80 | Transfers web content. |
| **HTTPS** | 443 | Secure version of HTTP using encryption. |
| **SMB** | 445 | Shares files and devices (e.g., printers). |
| **RDP** | 3389 | Remote desktop access with GUI. |

### Takeaway  

A very extensive lesson on Packets & Frames — one that definitely takes time to get comfortable with. I’ll be re-reading this section a few more times since I can still feel some gaps when trying to explain the concepts back to myself. That said, I’m looking forward to deepening my understanding here — networking fundamentals have always been something I’m genuinely interested in.
